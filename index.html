        <h1 class="info-title">About Dementia</h1>
        <p class="info-overview">
          Dementia describes a range of cognitive impairments that affect
          memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday
          activities. It is not a specific disease itself, but rather a group of
          symptoms that are caused by various underlying conditions. It affects
          around 50 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to
          rise to 152 million by 2050. Around 40% of dementia cases arise from
          risk factors that could be avoided. The most common type of dementia
          is Alzheimer's disease, but there are many other types as well, such
          as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and
          mixed dementia. Dementia is caused by a variety of diseases that cause
          damage to brain cells. This action causes an interference from one
          cell to another in your brain causing a lack of coherence and
          inconsistency in transmitting information to the body, which results
          in thoughts, behavior, memory, and emotions being affected and at risk
          of becoming uncontrollable. In addition, the brain is made up of many
          regions and each region has a separate function to be able to control
          the body. To dig deeper, if a separate functional region of the brain
          is affected while controlling an action, it will severely affect the
          functions and actions of that part.

        Tips for everyday Care for People with Dementia
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph__tips">
        Support should be sensitive to the person as an individual.It should
        also focus on promoting their wellbeing and meeting their needs.It's
        important to focus on what the person still does have, not on what they
        may have lost. Concentrate on what the person feels, rather than what
        they remember.The person with dementia may be experiencing a world that
        is very different to that of the people around them.Here are a few tips
        to consider early on and as the disease progresses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span
            >Try to keep a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating at the
            same time each day.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Help the person write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in
            a notebook or calendar.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Plan activities that the person enjoys and try to do them at the
            same time each day.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Consider a system or reminders for helping those who must take
            medications regularly.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >When dressing or bathing, allow the person to do as much as
            possible.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Buy loose-fitting, comfortable, easy-to-use clothing, such as
            clothes with elastic waistbands, fabric fasteners, or large zipper
            pulls instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Use a sturdy shower chair to support a person who is unsteady and
            to prevent falls. You can buy shower chairs at drug stores and
            medical supply stores.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Be gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do,
            step by step while you help them bathe or get dressed.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Serve meals in a consistent, familiar place and give the person
            enough time to eat.</span

        trouble remembering things.They also can become agitated and anxious,
        even angry.In some forms of dementia language abilities are affected
        such that people have trouble finding the right words or have difficulty
        speaking.You may feel frustrated or impatient, but it is important to
        understand that the disease is causing the change in communication
        skills, so to make it easier you can do the following:

            and frustrations. Try to show that you understand if the person is
            angry or fearful.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Allow the person to keep as much control in his or her life as

        </li>
        <li><span>Respect the person's personal space.</span></li>

        <li>
          <span
            >Keep well-loved objects and photographs around the house to help
            the person feel more secure.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span

        Tips for a Healthy and Active Lifestyle for People With Dementia
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph__tips">
        Eating healthy and staying active is good for everyone and especially
        for people with dementia.As the disease progresses, finding ways for the
        person to eat healthy and stay active may be challenging, so we have
        some tips that may help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span
            >Consider different activities the person can do to stay active,
            such as household chores, cooking and baking, exercise, and
            gardening. Match the activity to what the person can do.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Help get an activity started or join in to make the activity more
            fun. People with dementia may lack interest or initiative and can
            have trouble starting activities. But, if others do the planning,
            they may join in.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Add music to exercises or activities if it helps motivate the
            person. Dance to the music if possible.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Be realistic about how much activity can be done at one time.
            Several short “mini-workouts” may be best.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Take a walk together each day. Exercise is good for caregivers,
            too!</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Buy a variety of healthy foods, but consider food that is easy to
            prepare, such as premade salads and single portions.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Give the person choices about what to eat, for example, “Would you
            like yogurt or cottage cheese?”</span

        Tips for Home Safety for People With Dementia
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph__tips">
        As a caregiver or family member to a person with Dementia, you can take
        steps to make the home a safer place. Removing hazards and adding safety
        features around the home can help give the person more freedom to move
        around independently and safely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span
            >If you have stairs, make sure there is at least one handrail. Put
            carpet or safety grip strips on stairs, or mark the edges of steps
            with brightly colored tape so they are more visible.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Insert safety plugs into unused electrical outlets and consider
            safety latches on cabinet doors.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Clear away unused items and remove small rugs, electrical cords,
            and other items the person may trip over.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Make sure all rooms and outdoor areas the person visits have good
            lighting.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Remove curtains and rugs with busy patterns that may confuse the
            person.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            >Remove or lock up cleaning and household products, such as paint
            thinner and matches.</span
